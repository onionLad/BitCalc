# BitCalc
A calculator web app that can perform bitwise operations in addition to standard arithmetic.

## Tools & Languages
The plan is to use JavaScript and React to build our calculator. JavaScript gives us access to OOP and bitwise computations, while React allows us to easily organize and construct the calculator UI.
