# BitCalc
A calculator web app that can perform bitwise operations in addition to standard arithmetic. The calculator can be used to convert between bases, and computations can be stored on numbers of various bit sizes.

## Tools & Languages
The calculator will be built using JavaScript and React. JavaScript gives us access to OOP and bitwise computations, while React allows us to easily organize and construct the calculator UI. The BitCalc directory will have a shell script that can be run to open the calculator in your browser.

## Features
I want to design a calculator that keeps track of previous inputs, allowing you to see what have been previously calculated. Additionally, I want the calculator to handle the following operations:
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide
- Modulo
- Change Sign
- Change Base
- Change Integer Representation (uint32 vs int32 vs uint64 vs int64)
- Left & Right Shift
- Bitwise And
- Bitwise Or
- Bitwise Xor
- Bitwise Invert

## Usage
To run the calculator, `cd` into the BitCalc folder and run `bash runBitCalc`. The calculator will then be opened in your prefered browser.
