# BitCalc
A calculator web app that can perform bitwise operations in addition to standard arithmetic.

## Tools & Languages
The calculator will be built using JavaScript and React. JavaScript gives us access to OOP and bitwise computations, while React allows us to easily organize and construct the calculator UI.

## Features
I want to design a calculator that keeps track of previous inputs, allowing you to see what have been previously calculated. Additionally, I want the calculator to handle the following operations:
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide
- Clear
- Change Sign
- Change Base
- Change Integer Representation (uint32 vs int32 vs uint64 vs int64)
- Left & Right Shift
- Bitwise And
- Bitwise Or
- Bitwise Xor
- Bitwise Invert
